"""
Budget analysis logic — parses HCSS raw items into BudgetResult objects.

Terminology
-----------
budgeted_all_cost
    laborDollars + equipmentDollars + materialDollars + subcontractDollars
    + supplyDollars + customCostTypeDollars  (full HCSS planned budget).
    This is the ONLY value stored in the DB column `budgeted_all_cost`.

expected_budget  (quantity-weighted expected cost)
    = (actual_quantity / planned_quantity) * budgeted_all_cost
    Computed on the fly at response time in budget.py and detector.py once
    quantity data is joined.  Zero when no quantity data is available.

All downstream metrics — utilization_percentage, variance, loss_amount,
loss_pct, status — are computed at response time against expected_budget.
BudgetResult stores NO pre-computed metrics; they are all derived later.
